## 1\. Overview

Rublon MFA for Roundcube is a connector that enables Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) / Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) during user
logins.

Rublon adds an extra layer of security by prompting the user to
authenticate using an extra authentication method such as [Mobile
Push](https://rublon.com/product/mobile-push/). Even if a
malicious actor compromises the user\'s password, the hacker would not
be able to log in to the user\'s account because the second secure
factor will thwart them.

Rublon adds an extra layer of security **when a user signs in to a
system** (after the user enters the correct password).

When a user signs in to a system, the second authentication factor
should be initiated only after:

1.  The user has successfully completed the first authentication factor (e.g., entered the correct password)

2.  The user\'s unique Id and email address have been gathered
